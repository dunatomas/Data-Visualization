## Overview

This repository contains selected data visualization projects developed as part of the **Data Visualization** subject in my Master’s degree program, focusing on **data storytelling**, **visual clarity**, and **communicating insights effectively**.

The highlight of this repository is the **Final Project**, which was selected by the university as one of the **best examples** of student work and is showcased in the official **UOC Data Visualization portfolio**.

This project represents the culmination of the course and demonstrates my ability to:

- Transform complex data into **clear and engaging visual narratives**
- Apply **design principles** such as hierarchy, color theory, and visual balance
- Choose the **right visualization types** to support analytical insights
- Combine **data analysis and storytelling** for non-technical audiences

### Key aspects of the project
- **Dataset selection & creativity**: I chose a dataset with diverse data types to enable a wide range of visualizations and explore innovative approaches.
- **Data processing & preparation**: I processed, cleaned, and structured the data to make it ready for visualization.  
- **Data-driven storytelling**: The project follows a clear narrative structure rather than isolated charts.
- **Interactive & accessible visualizations**: The visualizations are designed to be interactive, informative, and accessible to a broad audience.
- **Audience-focused design**: The visualizations are designed to be interactive, informative, and accessible to a broad audience.

> 🏆 **Recognition**:
> This project was selected by the university as one of the best examples from the course and is publicly featured in the official Data Visualization student portfolio.

## 📁 Other Projects

### Mini Project

This section includes an earlier mini project developed during the course.

While more exploratory in nature, it reflects:

* Early experimentation with visualization techniques unsing _Tableau_
* The ability to design an effective data visualization using a **given fixed dataset**
* The learning process and progression throughout the subject
* Initial approaches to data storytelling later refined in the final project

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Demonstrated

* Data Visualization & Information Design  
* Visual Storytelling  
* Design Principles for Data  
* Data Visualization Tools: Tableau, Power BI, Flourish, Canva (interactive visual narratives)  
* Analytical Thinking & Insight Communication
