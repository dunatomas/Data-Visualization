## Overview

This repository contains selected data visualization projects developed as part of the **Data Visualization** subject in my Master’s degree program, focusing on **data storytelling**, **visual clarity**, and **communicating insights effectively**.

The highlight of this repository is the **Final Project**, which was selected by the university as one of the **best examples** of student work and is showcased in the official **UOC Data Visualization portfolio**.

This project represents the culmination of the course and demonstrates my ability to:

- Transform complex data into **clear and engaging visual narratives**.
- Apply **design principles** such as hierarchy, color theory, and visual balance.
- Choose the **right visualization types** to support analytical insights.
- Combine **data analysis and storytelling** for non-technical audiences.

### Key aspects of the project
- **Dataset selection & creativity**: I chose a dataset with diverse data types to enable a wide range of visualizations and explore innovative approaches.
- **Data processing & preparation**: I processed, cleaned, and structured the data to make it ready for visualization.  
- **Data-driven storytelling**: The project follows a clear narrative structure rather than isolated charts.
- **Interactive & accessible design**: The visualizations are designed to be interactive, informative, and accessible to a broad audience.

> 🏆 **Recognition**:
> This project was selected by the university as one of the best examples from the course and is publicly featured in the official Data Visualization student portfolio.

This section includes an earlier mini project developed during the course. While more exploratory in nature, it reflects:

* Early experimentation with visualization techniques unsing _Tableau_.
* The ability to design an effective data visualization using a **given fixed dataset**.
* The learning process and progression throughout the subject.
* Initial approaches to data storytelling later refined in the final project.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Demonstrated

* Data Visualization & Information Design.
* Visual Storytelling.
* Design Principles for Data.
* Data Visualization Tools: Tableau, Power BI, Flourish, Canva (interactive visual narratives).  
* Analytical Thinking & Insight Communication.
